# Music Downloader
My personal music downloader for youtube, spotify, soundcloud, etc (full list [here](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/blob/master/docs/supportedsites.md))  

# Instructions
Download the .zip from [releases](https://github.com/cin-ni/music-downloader/releases), extract it anywhere and run music_downloader.exe  

# Add to start menu (optional)
Create a shortcut to `music_downloader.exe` (the name of this shortcut is what will show in your start menu)  
Press Windows + R and enter `%ProgramData%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu`  
Place your shortcut in the Start Menu directory  
You should now be able to run it through your start menu
